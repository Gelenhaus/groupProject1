# LocalGrub
LocalGrub is a website that is designed to cloak domestic violence shelter searches and user requests for 911 assistance.
Front-facing, it appears as a local restaurant delivery randomizing service that will select a restaurant for you based on your category of interest.
However, once the user hovers over site content it will display the real details and instructions for the site.
Filling out the input form will return information for local domestic violence shelters nearby using Google OpenSearch API as well as uber ride time and pricing estimates using Uber API.

## USER STORY
#### AS A domestic abuse victim
#### I WANT a website where I can covertly find a shelter,
#### SO THAT I can find somewhere I can safely go to get help without appearing in search history
